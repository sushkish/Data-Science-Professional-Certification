This repository contains an essay titled “Why is Data Science called the new electricity?”, which explores the evolution of Data Science from the 1960s statistical methods to the era of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. The essay highlights how data became a driving force for innovation across industries, comparing its impact to that of electricity in the industrial age. It also discusses three major real-world applications: predictive analytics in healthcare for early disease detection, fraud detection in finance using machine learning, and data-driven decision-making in marketing and government for personalized services and policy planning.

The second component is the dataset analysis using Python and R. The dataset used is heart 2.csv. In Python (Jupyter Notebook), the analysis includes counting missing values, finding the top three correlations between numerical features, and plotting a histogram of age distribution. In R (R script), it calculates the mean, median, and variance for the age column and creates a ggplot bar chart for chest pain types. These steps demonstrate fundamental data cleaning, statistical computation, and visualization skills across two popular Data Science environments.

The final part is the role exploration report for the Data Scientist position, which explains the key responsibilities such as developing predictive models, data preprocessing, and visual storytelling. It also covers essential skills including Python, R, SQL, and machine learning, along with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP). The report references a real LinkedIn job post and highlights five core requirements for the role. All deliverables—Essay (PDF), Jupyter Notebook, R script, and Role Report (PDF)—are uploaded in this repository.
